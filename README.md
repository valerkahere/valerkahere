## What I do?

My career is a story of two worlds. On one hand, I'm a developer obsessed with building clean, logical solutions for the Web with HTML, CSS and Javascript. On the other, I'm a professional interpreter thriving on the precision required in high-stakes legal settings like courtrooms and tribunals.

I believe the same core skills drive success in both fields: a meticulous attention to detail, clarity under pressure, and the ability to bridge complex communication gaps. The only difference is the type of syntax error you're trying to prevent.

-   üíª **Currently:** A full-time Software Development student at **Atlantic Technological University (ATU) Sligo**.
-   üéôÔ∏è **Also:** A freelance Interpreter, ensuring nothing gets lost in translation.
-   üå± **Learning:** Always diving deeper into Front End and how to build modern and accessible UIs, therefore creating satisfying UXs.

### See My Work

You'll find my main projects pinned below, but here are the highlights:

-   **Automated Media Organizer:** Tired of a chaotic photo folder? I wrote a powerful Bash script that leverages `ExifTool` to sort thousands of files chronologically in seconds.
-   **OOP Fleet Management System:** An exploration into the depths of Object-Oriented Programming, building a complete vehicle management system from the ground up in C#.

### Random Thought üß†

A syntax error in C# gives you a compiler warning. A "syntax error" in a courtroom... well, the consequences are a bit different. It's taught me to be *very* careful with my logic.
